// A message keeps the name its writer had when they sent it: that is what the
// agent read, and rewriting it on a rename would change history the agent has
// already seen, and the provider's prompt cache with it. The screen shows who
// that person is NOW, with the name they sent it under when it differs, so a
// message sent before someone named themselves does not read as a stranger's.
